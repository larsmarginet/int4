# Thierry

Therry is an app that enables kids to discover the wonderful adventures behind paintings. Thieves, betrayels, jokes, etc. Guaranteed fun! 
They get sent postcards everyday and can scan them to unlock different levels. By unlocking these levels on a map, completing challenges and scrolling through an interactive story they experience this wonderful world. 

This PWA was made in reactJS and uses a lot of lottie and svg-animations.
